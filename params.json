{"name":"myGuide","tagline":"A wearable mobile app for the blind","body":"# The Mission\r\nThe mission of myGuide is to provide a method of vision for the blind. To accomplish this feat, we've built a wearable device consisting of an Arduino, a bluetooth transmitter, and a sonar sensor. The wearable device will relay the distance of the closest object based on sonar detection and the mobile app will vibrate the phone in intervals that are directly proportional to the distance. This provides an \"invisible walking cane\" that discretely enables the blind to navigate spaces without the need for carrying a cane.\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\nTo check out this repo, run the following command\r\n```\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/gtg489w/myGuide\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Project Structure\r\n## Mobile App\r\n/mobile_app/ contains a PhoneGap project that builds an Android app.\r\n\r\n## Arduino\r\n/arduino/ contains the sonar.io arduino file that should be deployed to the Arduino board. Additional Arduino wiring information can be found further down in this documentation.\r\n\r\n# Constructing the Device\r\n\r\n# Authors and Contributors\r\nBrian O'Connor - [@brian_legendary](https://twitter.com/brian_legendary)\r\nAilany Icassatti - [@RiseAboutiT](https://twitter.com/RiseAboutiT)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
